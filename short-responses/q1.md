# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

The danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend is that the API key will be visible. However, if we make an API request from the server side it will hide the API KEY and will keep it secure from anyone.
